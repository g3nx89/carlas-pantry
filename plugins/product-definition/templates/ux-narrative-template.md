## How to Use This Document

This UX narrative is a companion to the Figma mockups for {{PRODUCT_NAME}}. It provides structured, machine-readable descriptions of every screen, interaction, and navigation flow. Coding agents should use this document alongside the original Figma designs to implement the UI accurately.

**Precedence rule:** If there is a conflict between this narrative and the Figma mockup, the narrative takes precedence. The narrative reflects reviewed and validated design decisions, including any corrections identified during the coherence audit.

**Reading order:** Start with Global Patterns to understand shared components and conventions, then read individual Screen Narratives for implementation details.
