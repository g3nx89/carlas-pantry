## Differentiation Strategy

Based on research, our feature should differentiate by:

### Primary Differentiators
1. **{Differentiator 1}**: {Description and rationale from research}
2. **{Differentiator 2}**: {Description and rationale from research}

### Secondary Differentiators
1. **{Differentiator 3}**: {Description}

### What NOT to Differentiate On
{Areas where competing on features is not productive based on research}

---

## Contradictions & Debates

> Areas where research findings conflict or require judgment calls.

### Contradiction 1: {Topic}
**View A:** {Finding from one source}
**View B:** {Conflicting finding from another source}
**Resolution:** {Recommended approach or flag for user decision}

---

## Research Gaps

> Areas where more information would be valuable but research was inconclusive.

| Gap | Impact if Unresolved | Suggested Next Step |
|-----|---------------------|---------------------|
| {knowledge gap} | {risk} | {how to address later} |

---

## Implications for Specification

### Requirements to Add
Based on this research, the specification MUST include:
- {requirement 1}
- {requirement 2}

### Requirements to Reconsider
Based on this research, reconsider:
- {requirement that may need adjustment}

### Out of Scope Recommendations
Based on this research, explicitly exclude:
- {feature/scope item} - Reason: {research-based rationale}
