# Design Supplement: {{FEATURE_NAME}}

**Specification:** `specs/{{FEATURE_ID}}/spec.md`
**Design Brief:** `specs/{{FEATURE_ID}}/design-brief.md`
**Date:** {{DATE}}
**Mode:** {{MODE}} <!-- with_figma | spec_only -->

## Context

{{executive_summary}}

{{#if figma_available}}
**Figma Coverage:** {{covered_by_figma}}/{{requirements_total}} requirements covered by existing designs.
{{else}}
**No Figma designs available.** This document provides complete visual/interaction specs for all screens and states derived from the specification.
{{/if}}

> **Expected Divergence:** Gaps between Figma designs and this specification are normal and expected.
> Figma designs were created before full specification analysis. This supplement provides
> developer-ready specs for everything the spec requires that Figma does not cover.
