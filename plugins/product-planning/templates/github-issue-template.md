## Usage Notes

1. **Automated Generation:**
   - The planning workflow extracts values from artifacts
   - AC list comes from `spec.md`
   - Architecture decisions come from `design.md`
   - Task list comes from `tasks.md`
   - Test counts come from `test-plan.md`

2. **Labels to Apply:**
   - `feature` - Always
   - `planned` - To indicate planning is complete
   - Add relevant tech stack labels

3. **Project Assignment:**
   - Assign to appropriate project board
   - Set milestone if applicable

4. **Branch Linking:**
   - If on a feature branch, link to the branch
   - Format: `Implements: feature/{feature-name}`
