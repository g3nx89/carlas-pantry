# Implementation Skill Configuration
# Single source of truth for all configurable values used by the implement skill.
# Referenced by: skills/implement/SKILL.md and skills/implement/references/

# Lock protocol
lock:
  stale_timeout_minutes: 60  # Locks older than this are treated as stale and overridden

# Quality review (Stage 4)
quality_review:
  agent_count: 3  # Number of parallel reviewer agents when code-review skill is unavailable
  focus_areas:
    - "simplicity, DRY principles, and code elegance"
    - "bugs, functional correctness, and edge case handling"
    - "project conventions, abstractions, and pattern adherence"

# Severity classification (canonical definitions)
severity:
  critical:
    description: "Breaks functionality, security vulnerability, data loss risk"
    example: "Unvalidated user input in SQL query"
  high:
    description: "Likely to cause bugs, significant code quality issue"
    example: "Missing error handling on API call"
  medium:
    description: "Code smell, maintainability concern, minor pattern violation"
    example: "Duplicated logic across two files"
  low:
    description: "Style preference, minor optimization opportunity"
    example: "Variable naming inconsistency"

# Handoff artifact tiers (Stage 1 file classification)
# Required files halt if missing. Expected files warn if missing. Optional files are silent.
