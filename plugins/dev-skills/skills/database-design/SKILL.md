description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "design a database", "choose a database", "select an ORM", "plan indexes", "optimize queries", "design a schema", or needs guidance on database selection (PostgreSQL vs SQLite vs Neon), ORM choices (Drizzle vs Prisma), indexing strategies, and query optimization.

# Database Design

> **Learn to THINK, not copy SQL patterns.**

## Selective Reading Rule

**Read ONLY files relevant to the request!** Check the content map, find what you need.

| File | Description | When to Read |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `references/database-selection.md` | PostgreSQL vs Neon vs Turso vs SQLite | Choosing database |
| `references/orm-selection.md` | Drizzle vs Prisma vs Kysely | Choosing ORM |
| `references/schema-design.md` | Normalization, PKs, relationships | Designing schema |
| `references/indexing.md` | Index types, composite indexes | Performance tuning |
| `references/optimization.md` | N+1, EXPLAIN ANALYZE | Query optimization |
| `references/migrations.md` | Safe migrations, serverless DBs | Schema changes |

---

## Core Principle

- ASK user for database preferences when unclear
- Choose database/ORM based on CONTEXT
- Don't default to PostgreSQL for everything

---

## Decision Checklist

Before designing schema:

- [ ] Asked user about database preference?
- [ ] Chosen database for THIS context?
- [ ] Considered deployment environment?
- [ ] Planned index strategy?
- [ ] Defined relationship types?

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Default to PostgreSQL for simple apps (SQLite may suffice)
❌ Skip indexing
❌ Use SELECT * in production
❌ Store JSON when structured data is better
❌ Ignore N+1 queries
